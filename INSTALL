download the two files attached to this note to your windows system

    wav-player.py
    wav-player.service

transfer the two files to the raspberry pi Desktop using vnc:

    wav-player.py      -> Desktop
    wav-player.service -> Desktop

*** disable the key binding script before doing any command-line stuff! ***

do the following at a command line on the raspberry pi:

  sudo systemctl disable wav-player
  sudo systemctl stop    wav-player

now do these commands (watch out for funny single quotes):

  cd
  cat Desktop/wav-player.py      | tr -d '\r' > wav-player.py
  cat Desktop/wav-player.service | tr -d '\r' > wav-player.service

  sudo cp wav-player.service /etc/systemd/system/
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl start wav-player

if things appear to be working properly, then do:

  sudo systemctl enable wav-player

  rm Desktop/wav-player.py
  rm Desktop/wav-player.service

all should now be in its final state, ready to run on reboot
